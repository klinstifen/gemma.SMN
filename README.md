# gemma.SMN

##### Dependencies

[Adafruit_NeoPixel library] (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)

##### Description

gemma.SMN is a sketch written for the [Adafruit Gemma] (http://www.adafruit.com/gemma).  It converts a (S)tring to [(M)orse code] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code), and blinks out the result via [Adafruit (N)eoPixel strips] (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1461).

The project came about because I wanted to replace the red, blinking LED that I attach to my reflecting vest when running at night.  The light was bright enough, but I wanted more than the standard three blinking patterns.

The finished result is a set of three NeoPixel strips, powered by a 3.7v 500mAh Lipo that can blink a variety of morse code patterns.
