##### Description

gemma.SMN is a sketch written for the [Adafruit Gemma] (http://www.adafruit.com/gemma).  It converts a (S)tring to [(M)orse code] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code), and blinks out the result via [Adafruit (N)eoPixel strips] (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1461).

The project came about because I wanted to replace the red, blinking LED that I attach to my reflecting vest when running at night.  The light was bright enough, but I wanted more than the default three blinking patterns.

The finished result can take multiple strings (only alpha characters at present) and blink out the morse code equivalent over three strips of NeoPixels.

Here's a [demo video](https://youtu.be/Xvr2BQ920dc) of the sketch in action.
